We’re building the world’s most advanced healthcare platform from the ground up, combining hardware, software and doctors under one roof. As an early member of our world class product team, you’ll have a key role in rebuilding our country’s most important and most broken industry from first principles.Forward was founded in January 2016 by former executives and engineering leaders from Google and Uber. We are funded by some of the world's best investors and entrepreneurs including Founder's Fund, Khosla Ventures, First Round Capital, Eric Schmidt (Google/Alphabet Chairman), Marc Benioff (Salesforce Founder), Joe Lonsdale (Palantir Founder), Joshua Kushner (Oscar co-Founder) and Garrett Camp (Uber co-Founder).You can read our story here, check out a quick YouTube video, or recent press: New Yorker, TIME, USA Today, Forbes, WIRED.WHAT YOU'LL DO:Work on an inspiring team alongside our founders, PMs, designers, engineers hailing from top companies like: Google, Facebook, Uber, Palantir, frog, IDEOCombine the best of humans and technology to deliver an amazing user experienceOwn the roadmap for and implementation of our biggest projects; think Google vision + startup speedWork across a truly “full stack” product. Forward spans hardware, software, industrial design, data science, service design, and moreChallenge yourself working on a massive scope (many of our products could have been their own startup - we built our own telemedicine app, exam room screen, body scanner and electronic medical record)Lead interdisciplinary functional teams of designers, engineers, doctors and operations to build “clinical programs” - imagine redesigning dermatology from scratch and you start to get the ideaLearn what it takes to build a world-changing startup, both by osmosis and through constant interaction with our foundersYOU ARE:User-obsessed. You are deeply empathetic, constantly putting yourself in the shoes of our users (whether that be our patients or great clinical team).Impact-driven. You care about your impact upon the world.

You’re as comfortable talking shop with an doctor as you are with a designer or engineer.A good helicopter. You can alternate between 10,000 foot and 10 foot views easily, and at the right time. Product vision? Fit-and-finish? All in a day’s work.Creative. You don’t need to be asked to think outside of the box… you know when to climb hills and when to jump them.Scrappy. You’re a hustler who will get your hands dirty and protect your builders at every turn.A leader. You’re kind, charismatic and humble. Teams want to be in the trenches with you, and to build something great by your side.YOUR EXPERIENCE:5+ years tech experience.BA/BS required.

We’re building the world’s most advanced healthcare platform from the ground up, combining hardware, software and doctors under one roof. As an early member of our world class product team, you’ll have a key role in rebuilding our country’s most important and most broken industry from first principles.Forward was founded in January 2016 by former executives and engineering leaders from Google and Uber. We are funded by some of the world's best investors and entrepreneurs including Founder's Fund, Khosla Ventures, First Round Capital, Eric Schmidt (Google/Alphabet Chairman), Marc Benioff (Salesforce Founder), Joe Lonsdale (Palantir Founder), Joshua Kushner (Oscar co-Founder) and Garrett Camp (Uber co-Founder).You can read our story here, check out a quick YouTube video, or recent press: New Yorker, TIME, USA Today, Forbes, WIRED.WHAT YOU'LL DO:Work on an inspiring team alongside our founders, PMs, designers, engineers hailing from top companies like: Google, Facebook, Uber, Palantir, frog, IDEOCombine the best of humans and technology to deliver an amazing user experienceOwn the roadmap for and implementation of our biggest projects; think Google vision + startup speedWork across a truly “full stack” product. Forward spans hardware, software, industrial design, data science, service design, and moreChallenge yourself working on a massive scope (many of our products could have been their own startup - we built our own telemedicine app, exam room screen, body scanner and electronic medical record)Lead interdisciplinary functional teams of designers, engineers, doctors and operations to build “clinical programs” - imagine redesigning dermatology from scratch and you start to get the ideaLearn what it takes to build a world-changing startup, both by osmosis and through constant interaction with our foundersYOU ARE:User-obsessed. You are deeply empathetic, constantly putting yourself in the shoes of our users (whether that be our patients or great clinical team).Impact-driven. You care about your impact upon the world. That means more building and less talking as you working toward something that has a chance to change people’s lives.A Renaissance (wo)man. You’re curious. You’re always learning. You’re as comfortable talking shop with an doctor as you are with a designer or engineer.A good helicopter. You can alternate between 10,000 foot and 10 foot views easily, and at the right time. Product vision? Fit-and-finish? All in a day’s work.Creative. You don’t need to be asked to think outside of the box… you know when to climb hills and when to jump them.Scrappy. You’re a hustler who will get your hands dirty and protect your builders at every turn.A leader. You’re kind, charismatic and humble. Teams want to be in the trenches with you, and to build something great by your side.YOUR EXPERIENCE:5+ years tech experience.BA/BS required.
