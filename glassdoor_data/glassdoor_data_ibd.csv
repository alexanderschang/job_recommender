Reports to (title): EVP, Portfolio Manager

Company Description:

Founded in 1964, Alger is widely recognized as a pioneer of growth-style investment management. Headquartered in New York City with affiliate offices in Boston and London, Alger provides U.S. and non-U.S. institutional investors and financial advisors access to a suite of growth equity separate accounts, mutual funds, and privately offered investment vehicles. The firm’s investment philosophy, discovering companies undergoing Positive Dynamic Change, has been in place for over 50 years. In March 2017, Weatherbie Capital, LLC, a Boston-based investment adviser specializing in small and mid-cap growth equity investing, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alger.

Alger’s Investment Team is the engine that drives the Firm’s strong long-term investment returns of our portfolio strategies and success for our clients. Our investment strategies range from U.S. small cap to large cap stocks and International and Emerging Markets growth stocks, in both traditional long-only and long/short hedged equity portfolios. We are over 40 experienced professionals, led by our portfolio managers and senior sector analysts, who work together to identify and research domestic and global growth trends across all economic sectors to uncover compelling investment opportunities. We target “outside the box” ideas and our firm’s philosophy encourages creative and independent thinking. Each investment idea goes through a rigorous series of analyses. Many of our analysts have direct experience in the industries they invest in and/or advanced degrees in their fields. Compared to other buy-side firms, our teams are small – and this “boutique” culture allows analysts of all levels to contribute. Working in smaller groups, analysts have more responsibilities, rather than being just a “number-cruncher” at a larger firm. With that in mind, we focus on investing in developing talent.

We believe the financial system has let down the very people who need it most. Many small businesses are denied access to credit merely because their owners do not have great credit, or because they are not a priority for traditional lenders. There is a clear gap between those who can cheaply access finance and those who cannot access it at any price.

At XPRS, our goal and our mission is to use technology to bridge that gap. We use the latest technology to efficiently connect small businesses with capital so that these businesses, the lifeblood of the American economy, can grow and prosper.

We deliver small business loan application decisions in minutes and funding in as quickly as 1 business day. Less paperwork and less hassle means more time for you to focus on your business.

Unlike traditional banks, XPRS focuses on the cash flow and health of your business, not personal credit history. We use innovative ways to help small businesses like yours get access to capital quickly, efficiently, and affordably.","/Overview/Working-at-XPRS-Capital-LLC-EI_IE999739.11,27.htm"

Finally, maintaining a collegial, dynamic, team-oriented culture is of the utmost importance at TPH. Therefore, Summer Analysts will be judged on their ability to demonstrate these values during their internship. A significant portion of our full time Analyst and Associate classes come from our summer internships.

TPH offers an entrepreneurial, diverse culture where Summer Analysts interact with senior bankers / clients and are asked to make meaningful contributions to deals.

Financial Analyst,Squeeze,4.8,"Nashville, Tennessee",-1,-1,"We’re Squeeze, a feel-good company, from the Founders of Drybar.

Our mission is to use the power of massage to improve the health and happiness of our guests (and team members!), so they can be their best selves. We are committed to ensuring your experience with us is positive, rewarding and fulfilling.

A bit about us: Squeeze was designed to modernize the massage experience. Our revolutionary app-based booking and payment platform simplifies the process, making scheduling, paying, tipping, and rating easy, breezy, Squeezy. Similar to Postmates and Uber, after a Squeeze Massage, instead of dealing with a clunky, stressful checkout process, our guests simply float out with the ability to tip and rate their therapist at their leisure post massage.

Personalized services allow guests to select massage preferences as well as control in-room settings from lighting to temperature to sound, all in a beautifully designed space. It’s a completely fresh approach to a way better massage experience.

Additionally, we’ve partnered with an equally-minded “feel-good” nonprofit: Canine Companions for Independence. Canine Companions improves the lives of people with disabilities by providing highly trained assistance dogs at no charge to the recipient. Here’s how we’re partnering with them:

For every membership sold, Squeeze is helping to provide a day of canine support to a person with a disability through Canine Companions for Independence.
Local events throughout the year where Squeeze employees will have the opportunity to participate and volunteer.
And… Puppy Time! Periodically throughout the year, Canine Companions will bring puppies to our shop to brighten our spirit and day!

THE FEELS: OUR FIVE CORE VALUES

THE FEEL-GOOD REVOLUTION

DO WHAT YOU LOVE AND LET IT LOVE YOU BACK

We’re passionate about what we do, so we give it our all, each and every day. And it turns out, the more we give, the more we get back, which is pretty squeezing sweet.

LITTLE THINGS ARE BIG THINGS

We believe that sometimes the smallest things have the biggest impact. These little gestures may seem insignificant, but they add up to a meaningful difference in our guest’s experience, and the way we make them feel. So, don’t just think big. Think small.

BE CURIOUS AND CONFIDENT

Nobody likes feeling stiff or stuck. That’s why they get massages! And what’s true for the body is true for the soul. If we stretch ourselves to learn and grow, we’ll be invincible, both as individuals and as a company.

SHINE BRIGHT

Human touch is essential for life, and the benefits are astounding. In addition to elevating mood and reducing stress, studies show that a friendly touch releases oxytocin—the ""cuddle hormone""—which promotes feelings of trust, empathy, and love. It starts with us.
