Digital Enterprise Agility Operating Model - Principal Consultant,Information Services Group,4.4,United States,-1,-1,"The challenge of today’s IT environment is to be able to rapidly develop and release new capabilities while keeping stability across core applications. Various layers of development pace require an understanding of how value is defined, services are architected and consumed, and how workflows across delivery to meet the needs of the business and consumer.

An Enterprise Agility Digital Operating Model Consultant helps our clients realize the future state, to define and adopt a product-based operating model. In this role, you will help clients develop their technology product model, define the right governance and strategic functions, and create a flexible model for product teams. You will help them operate in a way that allows them to achieve product-specific business value, learn how to continuously iterate and improve that value by incorporating real customer feedback and insights, and successfully define organizational change management strategies to lead the client through the significant culture change needed by both the IT and Business organizations.

You will use ISG core frameworks and delivery approaches for operating model discovery, analysis, design, and implementation. These frameworks and approaches are used to help the client successfully transform from function-based siloes using a short-lived “project” delivery approach to more Business and IT cross-functional teams delivering in a more perpetual “products” approach. This shift, from project to product, must contemplate all components of the operating model to succeed. For IT shared-services departments, this means helping them create a digital backbone and products that enable development and product teams to adopt and use these services quickly, mindfully and sustainably. For software development and DevOps teams and the business, this means helping to develop, operate and improve the digital products that engage their end customers.

Through deep professional services engagements, the Digital Operating Model practice helps our clients define their target product-based operating model, including defining requirements and changes to their existing products/capabilities, delivery models, processes, and people/workforce. We then coach and facilitate the execution, including the culture change, working with their leaders and teams to ensure that the model is successful and sustainable.

We need consultants who can utilize their experience in Agile, DevOps, Lean, Product Management and modern technology delivery models (as-a-Service, automation, etc.) along with ISG design methodologies to enable a client to transform their operating model to a flexible yet cost effective agile enterprise.

Typical engagements the Enterprise Agility Digital Operating Model Principal Consultant will be involved in are:

• Workshops to inform clients about digital, operating model, enterprise agility, sourcing / solution and organizational market trends and developments

• Assessment of existing operating model and delivery environment

• Target operating model design (capabilities/products, value streams, delivery models, shared service functions, partner ecosystem, organization / teams / skills, technology landscape (at a very high level), governance and performance management of the IT estate)

• IT and Digital Strategy development

• IT Governance and decision rights design & implementation

• Partner ecosystem strategies

• Skills assessment and gap mitigation strategies

• Organization change management and culture change

• Organization design

• Coaching and facilitation in transformation to the new target operating model

The Digital Operating Model Principal Consultant supports operating model engagements under the direction of a director or partner either for a specific engagement or with an agreed role in a specific area of an engagement, and also supports internal practice development activities.

Knowledge, Skills and Experience Qualifications:

• 2+ years of digital operating model development and transformation

• 3+ years of Agile Development, Continuous Development in a DevOps environment, and/or Scrum consulting or delivery experience; developing or delivering complex operational solutions including shared and business services is a plus.

• Product Management disciplines, with scaled movement to product-orientation a plus.

• 5+ years in Information Technology, working in a technical delivery role (applications or infrastructure related roles).

• Competency in the following key disciplines is desirable:

o Application Development Lifecycle Management techniques (SDLCs such as Kanban, SCRUM, SAFe, etc.)

o DevOps practices and CI/CD automation and continuous delivery disciplines

o Cloud computing and cloud-native applications development and management

o Understanding of Service Lifecycle Management disciplines (Service Design, Service Transition, Service Operations, and Continual Improvement – ITIL, Cobit, IT4IT models)

Management Consultant,The Berkeley Partnership,4.9,"New York, NY",-1,-1,"When we ask someone to join The Berkeley Partnership, it’s a big decision, for us and for them. We work with big, high profile clients, shaping and delivering complex and transformational change. Our partners and consultants help these organisations tackle their most critical challenges, often by working as an integral part of their leadership teams. Our focus is always on making change happen, making it successful and making it last.  Our people focus on building trusting, long term client relationships and only selling work that clients need and want. We truly believe this is key to our success, and our repeat/referral business supports this. That’s why we can’t afford to compromise on the quality of people we hire. At Berkeley we look to hire and develop really passionate talented consultants not only hiring in at the most senior levels. We look for high achievers with at least 6 – 10 years’ consulting experience coming from top tier consulting firms. Joiners will have a proven project leadership track record, and the ability to build strong relationships with blue-chip clients.  But meeting our requirements is only part of the story. Life at The Berkeley Partnership is very different from larger firms. With freedom, trust and autonomy comes a high level of accountability. This is by no means a soft option. There’s a strong focus on personal and professional development, with a partner to consultant ratio of 1:4. We don’t do hierarchy. There are just two levels, Partner and Consultant and if the offer of Partnership comes, you’ll know it means something.  Being owner-managed, we can shape the kind of firm we want to work in. We offer our consultants the chance to develop themselves professionally and to work towards success for our clients and for the firm. Our trusting and open culture makes Berkeley both a professional and sociable place to work, with high levels of autonomy and little bureaucracy. You’ll need to be adaptable and open minded about different ways of working and projects/industry sectors that are outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes you’ll be leading, sometimes supporting. Sometimes you’ll be on your own, although there’s always support from your colleagues when you need it. The pressure can be every bit as high as you’ve experienced before but most of our people find it easier to balance their work and personal interests in a smaller, more flexible firm.  You’ll find our recruitment process thorough and demanding but friendly too. We know it’s a big time commitment, so we urge you to read our website carefully before taking the next step. If you are the right person for us and are ready for a significant career move, it’s time well spent.
