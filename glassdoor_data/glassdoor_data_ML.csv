Why Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.","/Overview/Working-at-Cisco-Systems-Engineering-Software-EI_IE1425.11,24_DIV1488034.htm"

WE ARE CISCO #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.","/Overview/Working-at-Cisco-Systems-Engineering-Software-EI_IE1425.11,24_DIV1488034.htm"

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects.

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We test our code and invest in the health of our systems. We push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow.
Primary ResponsibilitiesYou will...
Work with stakeholders to define the solutions to development problems and business requirements
Develop and maintain the features and capabilities of our data ingestion pipelines
Extract actionable and impactful insights from vast amounts of data
Develop and maintain the services that surface those insights and make them available for consumption in a performant manner
Create unit and integration tests for your code
Reproduce and fix bugs reported by internal and external users
Set goals and communicate often about your progress toward them
Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the engineering organization and our software
What We’re Looking For
A problem solver at heart
Much of our work revolves around problems that have no existing off-the-shelf solution or consensus on best practices. You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.

3+ years of engineering experience
Things move quickly in the data group. You’ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.
Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar
This will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.
Professional experience with Python data tools
Our data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.
Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies
We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.
Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs
Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!
Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.
Basic Linux skills
In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.
Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.
Excellent verbal and written communications skills
Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.
Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued
Data Science Background
While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.
Front End development experience
From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.
Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers
IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon’s EMR would also be an asset.
Continuous Integration & Deployment
IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible.

Why Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take ambitious steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

We Are Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart.

"Software Engineer, JSTOR Labs",ITHAKA,4.3,"Ann Arbor, MI",$65K-$81K ,"$71,841","Labs Software Engineer

Ann Arbor, MI

Associate

ITHAKA is seeking a Software Engineer, who will be a member of the JSTOR Labs team (https://labs.jstor.org). The Labs team tests out new ideas by partnering with publishers, libraries, and scholars to create experimental tools for research and teaching. These prototypes are released and refined as beta tools. When they show promise, the Labs Software Engineer will play a key role in evolving them into hardened, scalable, full-fledged applications and services for public use.

The Role

Our organization and this role are unique and will provide you with an opportunity few other places can offer including:

Be part of a tight-knit team rapidly developing innovative tools and services for the academic community.Access to the JSTOR corpus of rich content and associated“big data” in the development of tools and applications.Ability to leverage and improve the leading-edge technology stack used by the JSTOR platform.Ability to have a large impact, due to the high traffic and visibility JSTOR has, combined with playing a pivotal role in bringing the JSTOR Labs team’s innovation to that platform.

This role is best performed by a person with a high level of natural curiosity, that is eager to learn, and with an inclination to action. The role will often involve moving forward on concepts that are only loosely defined. An individual that is self-motivated and able to work with relatively high-level direction will do best in this role.

The Labs Software Engineer will be part of a small (eight member) distributed team. The team is highly collaborative and works closely with the entire ITHAKA/JSTOR organization as well as with external teams and organizations. As a member of the Labs team and the ITHAKA organization, the Labs Software Engineer will have access to a diverse, knowledgeable, and helpful group of colleagues.ResponsibilitiesThe Labs Software Engineer will be involved in all phases of product development from discovery through incubation and delivery. During product discovery, the Labs Software Engineer will have an active role in the identification and validation of new and evolving ideas. In this capacity, occasional (up to 4 times per year) travel may be required, most often to our New York City office. For those ideas proven to have merit the Labs Software Engineer will, under the direction of the Labs technical lead, work with the team to incrementally add/refine product features and improve the product implementation to achieve the quality, robustness and stability necessary to make the product or service available to millions of JSTOR users.

Applications developed by Labs take advantage of APIs and infrastructure provided by the core JSTOR platform to the extent possible. We build on this base to rapidly bring new ideas to life for testing and refinement with end users. During an incubation period, Labs applications will be maintained and administered by the Labs Software Engineer and the rest of the Labs team. This work will include the development of rich interactive user interfaces, the development and maintenance of back-end services (including API development), data analysis, content enrichment, and search index generation.

The Labs Software Engineer will primarily work with other members of the Labs team in the completion of an innovative set of tools supporting Text and Data Mining (TDM) by researchers, educators and students. The TDM platform includes a suite of user-facing tools and back-end services providing access to many millions of text documents for data mining. Some typical TDM applications include topic modeling and named entity recognition.Experience and SkillsThis position involves“full-stack” development skills and in this role, the Labs Software Engineer will be expected to work with both back-end and front-end technologies. It is not expected that a candidate will have deep experience in each of the specific tools or technologies mentioned, but some prior experience with the key elements commonly found in a complete application is desired. A few specific examples include:

Development of back-end services using cloud-based application services using a variety of AWS services and technologies, including EC2, DynamoDB, and Lambda. We are increasingly taking advantage of serverless architecture such as Lambda and containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.Development of user-facing applications. These are typically developed as Single Page Applications (SPAs) using modern javascript frameworks. Our current framework of choice is Vue (and Nuxt) but experience with other similar frameworks such as Angular or React would be beneficial.High-volume text and metadata processing. Many Labs projects and services involve data processing at scale on both structured and unstructured content.Use of semantic web technologies. Future Labs projects will increasingly leverage linked open data (LOD) and semantic web technologies. Interest and/or prior experience with RDF, JSON-LD, SPARQL, and RDF triple stores is highly desired.

Below is a list of skills and technology experience that would be desirable, but the more important characteristics are an eagerness and demonstrated ability to quickly learn new skills.

Agile development approaches



Lean-startup and design-thinking inspired methods incorporating short product development, business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning


Programming languages and operating systems



Python
Golang
Javascript
Unix/Linux/MacOSX
RDF, JSON-LD, SPARQL


Development and collaboration tools including Git, Slack, JIRA, and Trello


Web app development



Django
Node


Backend services



Enterprise search using SOLR/Lucene or ElasticSearch
Amazon Web Services (AWS) or other cloud service providers
Serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda)
Application containerization (using Docker or Kubernetes)


Javascript client frameworks



Vue and/or Nuxt
Webpack


Mobile development



Using responsive design and development techniques, possibly including the use of Progressive Web Application (PWA) techniques and technologies


Other



Jupyter notebooks
Large-scale text analysis (for topic modeling, named entity recognition, etc)
RDF, JSON-LD, and Sparql for knowledge graph development
Experience applying statistics, modeling, and machine learning

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
