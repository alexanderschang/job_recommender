Our customers are businesses that want to grow. They know there is power in using their data to communicate with their customers in more relevant and targeted ways, but the existing platforms in the market have always been too hard to use or too expensive to take advantage of. Klaviyo customers are passionate, hard-working, ambitious and have incredibly high standards. They expect to deliver the best experiences for their customers and expect us to deliver the best experiences for them, too. We are looking to add people to our team who can help build a world-class product that will continue to delight our customers and exceed their expectations of what's possible.

Team Openings
We're always looking for all types of dynamic and analytical Product Managers, but here are the specific teams we're looking to hire for now: • Marketing Automation

 • Email Templates

 • Profiles / CRM

 • Data Science (x3)


How you will make a difference:




Spec - PMs at Klaviyo go deep. They love to define every use case a customer would consider, document potential ways to solve, identify outstanding concerns, flag edge cases, and leave no stone unturned. They sweat the details and are passionate about making sure that every experience that could come from a feature is understood, anticipated, and handled elegantly.
Work with Customers - PMs at Klaviyo spend at least 15% of their time working closely with customers. We do deep dives with customers to work on actual marketing strategy and implementation; this helps us intimately understand what our customers are trying to accomplish and what stands in their way. You should feel excited about the chance to not only meet customers, but to spend time doing their job for them to truly experience their world.
Set and Manage Roadmap - PMs at Klaviyo understand the business and prioritize the most valuable efforts. Each PM takes ownership of a product area with their cross-functional team, and is responsible for helping set the priority order of what the team delivers on to advance our mission and maintain product quality. They communicate their roadmaps proactively, including when things change and why.
Write and Share - PMs at Klaviyo write and share early and often. We write ideas. We write use cases. We write requirements. We write release plans. Someone who joins Klaviyo must love to write and must be exceptional at articulating their thinking through written word. You should enjoy expressing your thinking on paper and reviewing your ideas with people around the company each week.
Wireframe - PMs at Klaviyo love to draw. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a wireframe is worth a million. PMs are quick to get on a whiteboard and explain their thinking, and even faster to document that thinking into expected use cases, behaviors and edge cases (see ""Spec"" above). You should love drawing pictures, getting feedback, and iterating on them.
Learn - PMs at Klaviyo are voracious learners. We are constantly passing book or article recommendations to each other, sharing interesting insights, and digging into unknown problems. A lack of experience/knowledge around a challenge is exciting because it means once we solve it, we are guaranteed to learn something new. You should love learning and tackling new challenges.
Think Critically - PMs at Klaviyo are sharp. We think deeply, quickly, and analytically. The rigor of thought is extreme here so we can ensure we're making the best decision possible at all times. You should love to tease out problems, break them down to small, digestible pieces, and put them back together elegantly.
Ship - PMs at Klaviyo get value into customer hands. At the end of the day, we are only as good as how our customers see us; we must deliver improved solutions and experiences every single day. PMs build close relationships with their cross-functional teams to efficiently spec, build, and release high quality product at a fast cadence. You should be energized by solving tough problems, but nothing should compare to the feeling of releasing value to customers and watching your success metrics move.





Who You Are:




2+ years of PM experience.
Want to learn and master new things.
Passionate about Product Management as a career.
Love wire-framing and sharing your ideas.
Hands on and not just ""part of determining strategy"".
Have opinions about products and features you love or really don't love.
Get excited about having big ideas, and even more excited about executing on them.

When it comes to creating products we believe that enterprise experiences deserve the craft, care, and delight that have become standard on the consumer side, and we're looking for people who feel the same.

Fast-forward one year. Here's what you'll have accomplished at Movable Ink:

Working closely with a team of talented engineers, data scientists, designers, and researchers your leadership style brought out the best in everyone and facilitated innovations we hadn't dreamed of. Your incessant drive to learn what was happening in the market, across industries, and in research literature expanded our understanding of what was even possible.
You deftly navigated the balance of trust, control, and autonomy to find the sweet spot that helped our users feel comfortable and capable working with AI. You supported research and design to fully explore and vet models of trust was that resulted in users integrating the product into their production workflows.
Your keen ability to identify and collaborate with stakeholders across the organization resulted in company-wide excitement for the work the AI team was doing. Because you were attuned to what was happening in the market, with competitors, and insights generated through research you were able to deftly identify new opportunities, rally the team, and prioritize accordingly.
Our sales and customer experience teams have your back because of your work with product marketing in defining go-to-market strategies, creating demos, supporting sales enablement, and supporting collateral for our customers. Your clear organization and communication around releases created a network of support that quickly pushed new features into the hands of our customers.
Our training, documentation, and technical support team love working with you because you were intentional about bringing them into the process and making sure they had the right context and information to create best-in-class training videos and support documentation.
On several occasions people in the office couldn't find you. Not because you were playing hookie, but because you deeply value getting out of the building and talking to customers. On many of these forays you took research, design, and/or engineering with you because you know how meaningful it is to be close to our customers. You didn't stop there though - when you got back to the office you made sure to debrief with the team and document your learnings, adding to our growing database of stories and insights.

In the past you have:

Shipped. This is not your first rodeo.
Worked in collaborative, cross-functional team environments with engineering, design, data science and research.
Have previous experience leading and building AI products.

General Application - Product Management,Propeller Health,4.6,"Madison, WI",$70K-$92K ,"$83,989","Thank you for your interest in Propeller. In light of the novel coronavirus, we've decided to temporarily pause filling our open positions and focus on addressing the near-term needs of our patients, customers, and team. We appreciate your patience through this unprecedented time, and encourage you to share your interest in Propeller by applying below to stay in the loop on our upcoming open positions. When we're in a better position to anticipate our talent and team building needs, we'll contact you if we decide that we have a potential fit for you in the future.

The Propeller Team

About Propeller

Asthma and COPD are two of the most frustrating challenges in healthcare. In the last 50 years, we've made huge leaps in developing new medicines and understanding the complexity of these diseases. Yet despite this progress, patients today aren't doing as well as they could be. Medicines aren't used correctly or consistently, and doctors don't have the tools they need to deliver personalized treatment.

Propeller Health is changing that. We are the leading digital health company in respiratory care. Our technology helps patients and their doctors understand their disease, informs better treatment decisions and improves the quality of life of people living with asthma or COPD.

Our mission is to make life better for every person and community affected by chronic respiratory disease.

Why This Job Is Important

Many patients have forgotten what it's like to not have trouble breathing. We've created a unique technology that combines hardware and software to digitally guide the course of therapy for patients and physicians managing respiratory diseases. Our small team enjoys working together to create and apply technology to challenging problems that have enormous social costs.

We empower people with asthma and COPD to lead their lives without limits; you'll create software that conquers respiratory disease, and learn something new every day as you pioneer new digital health solutions.

Consider Joining Us If You Are
Eager to work at a fast-paced startup company on a 5 to 7 person, self-governed, cross-functional team
Passionate about eliminating waste, and getting stuff done
Not afraid to experiment and fail. Failure is an opportunity to learn, and is embraced as a core tenet of Propeller.
Naturally curious, and believe in lifelong personal growth
Keenly interested in public health and finding solutions to complex healthcare problems
Deeply empathetic towards people who live with chronic illness and those who help care for them
Excited to contribute to our thriving culture by adding your unique background, experience, and perspective to our team
A believer that technology can help solve hard problems and change the world
Aware that technology, by itself, does not delight customers; the sweet spot is when we combine technology with practical solutions, surprises, utility, and social interaction

Product Management

The Product team is responsible for defining and implementing the vision and plan for all the products Propeller produces. We decide which features will be developed and more importantly which will not, set priorities and define requirements so Engineering and QA know what they need to build, test and deploy. We listen to what customers tell our Customer Experience team and many people to help us set priorities on bugs to fix and features to implement and do our best to help Propeller produce good products. We help with user research, for qualitative and quantitative insights into what people want. The product design team provides guidance for visual and user experience for all Propeller products.
Our Product Management team includes; Patient Experience Product Manager, Provider Experience Product Manager, Product Development User Researcher, and Product Designers.

What's In It For You

Work with a smart, creative and diverse team of professionals. Solving respiratory disease requires a wide array of disciplines to work together. For example, we have epidemiologists, physicians/clinicians on staff combined with engineers, statisticians and data scientists to build the best respiratory solution possible.
Connecting as a team is important to us. We create plenty of opportunities to get together, such as regular summer cookouts for lunch, after work events like board game and hobby night, and our annual company-wide camping trip! You can opt in where it makes sense for you.
We care about balancing work with the rest of life. We encourage and support our team members to disconnect when they're not at work.
A great office location in downtown Madison, steps from fun restaurants and shops!

Propeller Health is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive team with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, each helping us understand our patients better, and strengthen our team. We firmly believe that hiring and supporting a diverse team allows us to do the best work of our lives, and make the disease experience different. To do this, we strive to maximize access to every opportunity, cultivate a diverse set of candidates, and if hired, providing them with support, mentorship, and growth opportunities. We don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, ability status, or any other differences.

Senior Product Manager,Hopper,3.8,"Boston, MA",$77K-$142K ,"$106,051","ABOUT HOPPERAt Hopper, we’re on a mission to make booking travel faster, easier, and more transparent. We are leveraging the power that comes from combining massive amounts of data and machine learning to build the world’s fastest-growing travel app -- one that enables our customers to save money and travel more. With over $235M CAD in funding from leading investors in both Canada and the US, Hopper is primed to continue its path toward becoming the go-to way to book travel as the world continues its shift to mobile.Recognized as the fastest-growing travel app by Forbes and one of the world’s most innovative companies by Fast Company two years in a row, Hopper has been downloaded over 40 million times and has helped travelers plan over 100 million trips and counting. The app has received high praise in the form of mobile accolades such as the Webby Award for Best Travel App of 2019, the Google Play Award for Standout Startup of 2016 and Apple’s App Store Best of 2015. Take off with us!THE ROLEProduct Managers at Hopper are “smart creatives” that will take the Hopper app from a disruptive, startup product to being the global leader in mobile travel. As a Product Manager, you will work at the intersection of development, data science, and user experience, as well as have a competitive understanding of the travel landscape to facilitate the creation of successful new features. On any given day - whether you’re weighing the tradeoffs of offering new features, scoping and specifying solutions, or shepherding features through development - your contribution will be critical to Hopper’s current and future success. Hopper’s Air product has been one of the biggest disruptors in the travel space since its launch in early 2015, helping travelers plan over 100 million trips and save nearly $2.5 billion along the way by leveraging big data technologies to help users understand the best time and destinations to fly, and more importantly, the best time to book airfare. We are looking for Product Managers to own the product roadmap to scale the Air product to be the preeminent destination for travelers when purchasing flights. This means exciting opportunities to own the booking funnel, sell ancillary products, and alleviate anxiety for millions of travelers. If you’re looking to dive deep into the challenges of scaling an established product to the market leader, look no further. THE PRODUCTUntil recently, billions of dollars of flights and hotels had been purchased through Hopper by customers paying in full for their trip at time of booking. Over the last several years, installment payments have changed the way consumers spend money online, and in travel particularly, with over 30% of online shoppers stating they would not have made a purchase had the option to finance it not existed. This problem is particularly pronounced in travel, given the need to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars upfront often several months prior to their trip.While the largest travel companies in the world now plug in to third party widgets to offer customers the ability to finance their trips, Hopper is leveraging its data science DNA to build an internal banking and lending function to offer this natively, the first travel company in the world to do so. Installments payments launched on Hopper in April 2020, is scaling quickly, and requires a senior product person to own it end-to-end.IN THIS ROLE, YOU WILL:Manage a product roadmap for a set of features from inception through implementation; collect requirements, establish key performance metrics, craft the user experience, and drive executionCollaborate closely with data science to dive deep into our data to understand our usersWork with business leaders to help shape and drive business cases for product features Ideate and wireframe new features that will be in the hands of millions of users across the globeIdentify the essential qualities of each feature: what's important, what's not, how can we limit cost and risk?Understand and explain complex technical issues, discern impact, and communicate them to maximize clarity and drive resolutionUse good judgment to make appropriate trade-offs when scoping and specifying solutions, ensuring that anything we build adds value to the business and continues to delight our usersA PERFECT CANDIDATE HAS:Thrived in a consumer product role and delivered delightful features at scaleAn innovative and detail-oriented approach to problem-solvingThe instinct to get on a whiteboard and explain their thinking, and even faster to document that thinking into expected use cases and user behaviors, driving UX for new features from start to finishExceptional ability to grasp, manage, and articulate complex systemsExperience connecting innovative solutions to real-world, user problems with actual business needs of a rapidly scaling organizationTechnical depth that allows you to communicate with, understand, and earn the respect of world-class engineers and data scientistsA track record of being proactive and persuading colleagues by constructing a compelling narrative both in-person and in-writingPast success analyzing data, drawing accurate conclusions, and adjusting strategy accordinglyNo ego.

Now we are investing millions in fiber networks and collaborating with small towns to change what Americans expect from their Internet service and their providers.

"Senior Product Manager, Core Services",PubNub,4.3,"San Francisco, CA",$75K-$139K ,"$105,097","PubNub powers apps that bring people together in realtime for remote work, play, learning, and health. Thousands of companies use PubNub's Realtime Communication Platform and its APIs as the foundation for online chat, live events, geolocation, remote control, and live updates, at massive global scale. Since 2010, PubNub has invested in the tools and global infrastructure required to serve customers like Atlassian, Hasbro, Peloton, and RingCentral, delivering SOC 2 Type 2 security and reliability while meeting regulatory needs like HIPAA and GDPR. PubNub has raised over $70M from notable investors like Sapphire, Scale, Relay, Cisco, Bosch, Ericsson, and HPE.

Like mission critical platforms that operate at a scale of tens of billions of API calls a day? Want to continue driving forward the realtime revolution that is transforming industries and disrupting the status quo? Excited about Product Management and Engineering excellence, about combining great rigor and discipline with fast paced innovation? Then get ready to get on the PubNub rocket ship!

The Product team at PubNub is expanding and we're looking for awesome, motivated, talented Product Managers to join us and to help drive forward our product strategy. PubNub is proud to be an EEO employer.What You Will Be Doing:

You will define the roadmap for specific APIs in our realtime portfolio. From ideation to initiative and requirements definition to project execution to launch, you will be the driving force. Of course, you will work within the context of overall product and company strategy. But you will own your part.
You will work with your Engineering team(s) to execute on the vision, both yours and the company's. We're here to be wildly successful and everyone has to do his or her part. Making sure Engineering understands what they need to build and why is certainly a key part of it. But also getting into the weeds of the process sometimes will be required, to ensure the output is exactly what you wanted to begin with.
You will be leveraging data and, perhaps more important, always exploring ways to do more with data in order to help make your product and PubNub that much more successful. At the scale at which we operate, we sit upon a wealth of data that can help us improve and innovate.
You will help the PubNub PM team evolve and improve. Everyone brings their own experiences and talents and learnings to the table. We want to learn as much as teach. The team is small and the processes new. Helping to build out teams and make teams great are two awesome things to put on you resume (many years from now).

Must Haves (Our P-Zeros If You Will):Like any great PM, you know how to communicate: from making sure Engineering understands the whats and whys of features to laying out the product vision to eager stakeholders to interacting with customers.


You code. We're a developer platform. Our product is an API. Not that you'll be coding for real but if you're not feeling the itch to build something, then you're probably not feeling the PubNub love. We won't check out your Github account but you probably have one.
You're a proven PM. You've been doing this for some time. 5 years, at minimum. Quality of experience is as important though: great talent we want but seasoned enough to step into a role with direct control over major parts of our globally distributed and highly scalable product.
You possess a high capacity for empathy. How else are you going to connect to your customers? You can get immersed in the problem space and imagine solutions and work with engineering to perfect those ideas (or come up with even better ones).
You love seeing your features and product in action. Execution is almost pathological in your nature. It doesn't mean that you're reckless but that you have a constant need to move the proverbial ball forwards. We have lots to do and folks wanting relaxed schedules should not apply!

Why PubNub?We work hard and have fun doing it! We believe that we are creating something that will truly transform how people interact with technology, and support that with an amazing culture and great benefits:


Competitive salary and stock options
Great culture and team spirit
Generous paid medical/dental/vision coverage plus medical and dependent FSA

Web Product Manager,The Center for Action & Contemplation,4.0,"Albuquerque, NM",-1,-1,"The CAC:

The Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC) exists to awaken a more loving world through the teaching and practice of the Christian contemplative tradition. Internally, we are creating a modern workplace with the professional skills needed to scale the work of the CAC to reach a larger audience.

The Job Opportunity:

The Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC) has a difficult, if not unusual, challenge, and an amazing opportunity to meet it head on. The challenge: There are many ways people interact with CAC on the web, including a bookstore, an online education portal, daily emails to over 300,000 constituents, registration pages for events, donation pages, 30 years of teaching materials from Richard Rohr, and much more. How do we offer all of this within a user experience that is full-featured yet modern, simple, and accessible while also conveying the CACs essence?

The CAC is blessed with thoughtful and experienced leaders who bring an abundance of expertise to the table. From design to branding to programs to communication to technology and more, each is a passionate advocate for their own area of responsibility.

We are seeking a candidate to join our leaders in the role of Web Product Manager as a strategic synthesizer. Our ideal candidate can sit in the middle, synthesize various perspectives, work with expert outside help, and orchestrate something magical. And from that day forward, continuously seek improvements to the user experience in all its many forms, continually seeking feedback, analyzing what is working, and what could be better. All without sacrificing the elegant, simple user experience that supports our mission.

We are not looking for the mad solo genius who can meet this challenge single handedly. Quite the opposite. We are looking for a clear-thinking collaborator and fair-minded arbiter who understands all of the elements of what it takes to build and maintain a successful, multi-dimensional web presence. Someone who can manage the process and consistently move the ball forward toward an ever-improving future.

The Web Product Manager will communicate daily with stakeholders around the organization to understand their needs, their hopes, and their fears. You will be their advocate, their reality check, the one who figures out what is possible, what it costs, and then makes it happen.

While technical expertise is important, this role will be more focused on leadership and strategy. You must be able to gather and translate user needs into well-defined requirements and user stories to be implemented by internal and external technical resources. The most important skill is the ability to manage technical staff and external developers while understanding the details of their work.

Your relevant product domain will include the creation and iterative development of the main CAC.org website, core teacher websites, other distributed microsites, custom web tools, and web-based elements of other digital products (e.g., the front-end of our online store, donation pages, registration pages, online courses, and more).

Note that the Web Product Manager is not responsible for the development of content, design, or specific engagement strategies, but you should have a strong sense for all of it and know good UI/UX when you see it. Youd collaborate with several teams, most significantly our Creative and Engagement teams, and feel a deep responsibility for understanding and bringing their work into reality.

The Web Product Manager will also work side-by-side with the Managing Director of Digital Products and CRM Product Manager in a highly coordinated, team-oriented and results-focused Digital Product team.

Additional information on the Digital Product Team approach to technology can be found here.
