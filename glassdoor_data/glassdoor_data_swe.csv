And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart.

Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.We Are Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.

We Are Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

Why Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

To do this well, they leverage the expertise of our Support Engineering Team, composed of technical subject matter experts on the frontlines of critical customer issues.

Our Escalation Engineers are our go-to resource for our most challenging customer cases, which can include technical complexity or politically charged escalations. They are the ones that are able to take ownership of any customer issue and see it through to resolution. In this Escalation Engineering role you should expect to be delving deep into database engine internals and memory allocators, investigating Linux performance or host configurations to see how they might be impacting the database, or troubleshooting complex SQL query behavior, all in the name of resolving critical customer or product issues.

As a member of our Support Engineering team, you will be constantly learning a wide range of customer systems and technical concepts or new product features to ensure you are ready to handle the new and exciting challenges that customers encounter. To accurately identify the source and solution of an issue, this team will take the time to learn about the customer's business and systems while helping to improve their fundamental MemSQL and database operational knowledge. This often requires additional research and time spent on learning new technologies and tools outside of MemSQL while also being deeply engaged with multiple departments including engine development teams, query performance, product management, infrastructure SREs, and others.

Role and Responsibilities

Provide email and live technical support to our enterprise customers.
Act as our highest escalation point for critical customer outages and escalations.
Identify and reproduce product issues and submit formal bug reports or feature requests to the appropriate development team.
Oversee postmortems and root cause analyses with the intention to prevent a repeat occurrence and to improve the product or internal procedures.
Identify and recommend product changes or improvements to better meet our customer's needs or reduce any friction of using MemSQL.
Collaborate with software developers, solution engineers, and technical account managers to keep all teams up to date with current issues a customer may be facing.
Work to streamline and improve various Support and Engineering processes and troubleshooting tools, author new internal run-books or public documentation, and help the team continually improve efficiency and effectiveness.
Participate in our team-wide on-call rotation that may include weekends and holidays or time required outside of normal business hours.

Required Skills and Experience

8+ years of previous escalation engineering or technical support experience.
Mastery of SQL databases and advanced skills with writing, optimizing, or debugging complex SQL queries or workloads. It is expected that you can interpret profiles and explain plans to understand performance and identify any issues.
A solid Linux devops/sysadmin skill set. That means you are hands-on with Linux and you know three ways to find a file, check utilization of system I/O, measure network throughput, and are comfortable navigating large log files.
Experience coding in one of the following: C, C++, Java, Python, Go
Familiarity with distributed systems and AWS/GCP. You understand how organizations deploy and maintain distributed applications and services across multiple machines.
Strong written and verbal English communication skills. Have the ability to explain technical concepts to a wide range of end-users.

Why you might like this job:    You’ve been building large rails apps for other companies. The ones with carrots dangling in front of you, hipster benefits, slippery ladders, and always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software. You like the idea of working for a locally owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like it that your work matters today and will affect millions of business customers of ours.  You like the idea that you could find a place like this in Spokane, where we have 4 seasons, you can buy a great house for a great price and if you have to commute longer than 20 minutes here, people would probably move or not work there. You like it that there’s 5 ski hills within 2 hours. Endless outdoor activities, and people who are here don’t want you bragging about it to cool actual tech cities. You don’t like bugs or humidity or a million people living in your city.  You love to code, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was ok or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because ok or good isn’t fulfilling to you.  But… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3 depending on if you have religion in your life. Our goal is to use the incredible business we’ve been blessed to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life and then we think we’ll have more fun working together during the day, if we know there’s a clear cut off and can create a work environment where we can not only go home, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. There’s no hipster saving or changing the world bs mission statement here. We try to make it a non-hostile job that pays well and doesn’t stress you out so you can call it a day and go have fun personally.  Benefits:  

Great Wage
18 days paid time off
4 paid holidays off of your choosing

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

=== WHY CISCO ===
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
We Are Cisco."

Why Cisco#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

This is possible because you’ll continue to get paid on deals you closed the prior year. 

Of course, earning at this level is a lot easier when you have something unique and valuable to bring to your customers. (Keep reading, and I promise we’ll get to this.)

RESPONSIBILITIES


Own projects end-to-end, from initial design, to prototype, to large-scale rollout.
Design and implement backend models and API endpoints for complex scientific workflows.
Design and implement rich frontend components and architecture. We build and operate one of the largest, richest React applications out there and power complex scientific analyses.
Work closely with product managers, designers, marketing, and sales to ensure the right context is being shared.
Help rapidly scale our product and team. As a member of the engineering team, you'll be an integral part of how we mature our tooling, best practices, engineering processes, and hiring.

Build software with a product-first approach. You ship code quickly and care about the real world impact of your code.
Have strong abilities in problem solving and iterating on feedback.
Enjoy ownership and building key pieces of product.
Are interested in learning more about life science (prior knowledge is not required; desire to learn is a must).

YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Check out our engineering blog for some examples of past work. Here are some other examples of recent and future projects:


Tools to simulate DNA assembly - computers can assist scientists by informing scientific decisions with complex calculations. Our bulk assembly tool allows scientists to simulate constructing hundreds of DNA constructs in parallel, visualizing the end result and highlighting potential issues.
Complex querying and visualization tools - The big advantage of keeping all your data stored in one system is that you can query that data all at once, without digging up multiple sources. This works best when you can query Benchling the same way you can query a database: by choosing from a large number of possible filters on any related objects, joining together various sources, and performing aggregations. We want to enable this in a user-friendly experience, without leaving your browser.
A customizable computation platform - Biologics are typically large protein complexes composed of a number of shared parts. We want to let scientists specify computations that can aggregate data across all of these related entities to surface derived values, which can be used in everything from data analysis to naming schemes. Scientists may develop custom protein analysis algorithms or proprietary validation logic - they'll be able to hook in custom code and push that computation to Benchling.
Data warehouse as a product - customers can click a button and spin up a fully-managed, query-able warehouse with all their Benchling data in one place. Customers get the full power of Redshift/Postgres without having to manage ETL pipelines or tune Postgres configuration values.
A new permissions system - Our existing permission system relies on Read/Write/Admin access that can only be applied at the top level of the file hierarchy. To roll out to enterprises with 500+ users, we need to offer them fine-grained control around exactly what actions a user can take and let them manage these in a hierarchical fashion.

OUR VALUES

Empower through information. We explain the ""why"" behind every decision, unless there are highly sensitive circumstances. We're honest about how we're doing, especially in difficult times. We believe that sharing information builds trust and enables better decision-making.
Rely on tenacity. Hard work is one of the greatest factors to determine success and is fully under our control. We must make the most of every day by bringing the highest level of determination. Dreaming big is not enough.
Raise the bar. Pushing ourselves and others to improve will be uncomfortable and at times result in failure. However, it's critical to our success. We're dedicated to creating a place where everyone feels challenged to improve.
Build a lever. We choose to build tools and infrastructure that will help others make world-changing innovations. There's less glory in it, but in the words of Archimedes, ""Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.""
